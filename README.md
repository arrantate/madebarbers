Created with React.js. The owner of made barbers told me he wanted a fast website that his customers could use to book an appointment in his shops.  He left me with the following testimonial:

I was looking for a someone to design a website for my barbering business.
I have two shops and a third one coming next year, So I needed someone who would listen to what I need but also guide me in the right direction.
Since my business requires talking to people. A big part of its success has been creating a welcoming, relaxed but also professional environment.
After discussing this with various designers, Arran was the only one who truly grasped what concept I was going for and he exceeded my expectations greatly.

Not only that but I needed a website people could book an appointment through so it needed to have a fast loading time be reliable. I haven't had one customer yet complain about not being able to use the website.

I will no doubt continue to use Arran for all of my future endeavours.

Believe me when I say you are in safe hands.
